      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Nagito Komaeda (狛枝 凪斗), is a student of Hope's Peak Academy's Class
        77-B, and a participant of the Killing School Trip featured in
        Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. His title is the Ultimate Lucky Student
        (超高校級の「幸運」 lit. Super High School Level Good Luck). He, along
        with Class 77-B, return in Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High
        School to explore their school life leading up to The Tragedy. He also
        makes an appearance in Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls
        as "Servant" (召使い meshitsukai). He returns once again as the
        protagonist of the OVA Danganronpa 2.5: Nagito Komaeda and the World
        Vanquisher, exploring his ideal world.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Nagito is a tall, skinny young man with notably wide shoulders, sickly
        pale skin and light gray-green eyes with thick eyelashes. His hair is
        shoulder-length and naturally wavy, of an unnaturally pale pinkish
        off-white color that fades to white the closer to his scalp, and is
        described as looking like it "doesn't belong to a living person"[5]. In
        Danganronpa 2, his hair has a slightly warmer, cream tone to it, but in
        Danganronpa 3 his hair appears silvery-white with grey tones. By the
        events of Danganronpa Another Episode, which is several years later, his
        hair is longer, messier, and darker (presumably with dirt). <br />Nagito
        wears a thin, knee-length dark green zipper coat with a jagged-cut tail,
        which he leaves unzipped. It has a red square pattern across the right
        shoulder, and a large, square-shaped '55' on the back, as well as two
        red drawstrings, threaded through the hood, hanging down on either side
        of his chest. Underneath, he wears a white scoop-neck T-shirt with a red
        design on the front, somewhat resembling two interlocking hooks. He
        wears plain black jeans, and a wallet chain with a skull charm, and pale
        brown shoes, each fastened by two zippers.<br />
        While attending Hope's Peak Academy, he wears the school's uniform: a
        brown blazer and matching pants, a red tie and dark brown lace-up shoes.
        The top few buttons of his shirt he leaves undone, and over it he wears
        a sleeveless green sweater with a red v-neck collar, a wide, horizontal
        stripe across the middle of it. <br />In Danganronpa Another Episode, as
        the Servant and Ultimate Despair, he wears a cropped black jacket, with
        three white buttons on the right and one red button on the left.
        Underneath, he wears a dark-red and olive-green scoop-neck shirt, with
        long sleeves that are folded over the cuffs of the jacket, and under
        this is a long beige undershirt. He wears black jeans with black low
        heeled shoes, tied with red shoelaces. He has a striped mitten on his
        left hand, to hide Junko's hand with long, red nails, sewn in place of
        his real hand. He also has a collar around his neck, given to him by the
        Warriors of Hope, with a chain hanging down the front, all the way down
        to his knees. The Servant is described to be constantly smiling, no
        matter what treatment he receives, and he is also said to have "a rather
        attractive face", and Genocide Jack even calls him "a pretty boy". His
        skinny build is also mentioned when she calls him "a skinny white-haired
        guy".<br />
        After waking from a coma on Jabberwock Island and having his
        brainwashing is undone, he replaced his non-functional left hand from
        Junko's corpse with a robotic forearm and hand. The prosthetic is white
        on the outer side and black on the underside. The palm is black, the
        backs of his fingers are white, and his thumb is white as well. The
        sleeve of his coat has been ripped where the new arm is, most of the
        jagged material still attached. The arm makes a rather loud mechanical
        sound whenever he moves it.
      </p>
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>
        Nagito first comes off as a polite, friendly, and easygoing, yet
        somewhat insecure boy. Hajime Hinata even mentions that his bright smile
        is very comforting. He was the only one that stayed with Hajime while he
        was unconscious, and expressed concern for his well-being, even after
        Hajime told him to go away. Though friendly with everyone, he is mostly
        interested in spending time with Hajime and can be quite clingy, and as
        a result, Hajime considers him a little annoying and not the most
        reliable, but still thinks he's a kind person.
        <br />
        Nagito attempts to be the team's conflict mediator and a poster boy for
        optimism, often encouraging others to be hopeful and to cooperate,
        however, he isn't taken very seriously. Hiyoko Saionji makes fun of him
        and considers his dramatic pep talks about hope and friendship
        embarrassing and tiresome. He is generally quite submissive and has a
        self-deprecating attitude, even agreeing with Hiyoko and the others'
        snide remarks.
        <br />
        Although he claims to be a pessimist, Nagito often appears unusually
        carefree; he lacks tact and occasionally says awkward, strange, and
        unsettling things without realizing it. At times he can also be more
        forceful; he is quick to scold Hajime when he's being too pessimistic or
        when he thought he was bullying Mikan Tsumiki. He is also notably
        annoyed by Teruteru Hanamura's treatment of girls and takes it upon
        himself to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't harass anyone.
      </p>
      <h2>Beliefs (hope mention?)</h2>
      <p>
        During the first Class Trial, Nagito is revealed to have a twisted
        obsession with hope. As a result, he often begins to ramble on about
        hope, sometimes rather abruptly—just talking or hearing someone else
        talk about hope or speak in a hopeful manner can render him in a state
        of bliss, causing him to sweat, and hold himself in order to contain his
        excitement. Furthermore, he sometimes has sudden outbursts in which his
        eyes darken and start to swirl (Hajime describes the look "a crude mix
        of hope and despair") while he rambles even more enthusiastically, but
        he usually snaps out of it fairly quickly and seemingly isn't aware of
        what happened.
        <br />
        He believes hope is an absolute good, and any deed done in the name of
        hope is righteous, even murder. He feels no guilt for hurting others in
        the name of hope, as he believes that hope will always win in the end
        and justify the means. He believes there are constant clashes between
        two or more hopes, and that "strong hope" will devour "weak hope"
        (adoringly, he calls this process "poetry in motion"). To him, ordinary
        untalented people, despair, and weak hope are just stepladders for
        creating stronger hope, and he considers these things necessary, while
        simultaneously having aversion to them. Nagito believes that the
        Ultimates are chosen at birth, and are capable of strengthening their
        own hopes by facing and defeating despair, instead of being broken by it
        like weaker, ordinary people. Like Hope's Peak Academy, Nagito strongly
        associates hope with talent and talent with worth.
        <br />
        Nagito desires to help to create the absolute hope that can overcome any
        despair, and he believes that the Ultimates can become embodiments of
        hope. However, he doesn't consider his luck to be a true talent and thus
        doesn't consider himself an Ultimate (despite this, he has also
        mentioned that his luck is the only good thing about him, and he
        sometimes finds it very useful). Instead, he desires to be a
        "stepladder", and sacrifice himself so the other Ultimates can shine.
        Considering himself a lower being, he often feels shame just for being
        in their presence. He confuses his obsession with the Ultimates' hope
        with pure, platonic love for his classmates and he genuinely believes
        he's doing good for everyone's sake. He has a strong desire to be useful
        and he is very self-sacrificing, but his ways of helping are often very
        wrong, harmful and potentially very dangerous, as he is willing to cause
        temporary despair in order to have hope born from it. He has little
        regard for his own well-being and doesn't care for his own life, and
        encourages the other students to kill him to achieve their own hope. He
        believes that dying for the sake of hope is an honor and the only way
        for "someone like [him]" to be useful to the world. In his Island Mode
        ending, Nagito reveals that he wishes to die so he can finally be free
        from the suffering caused by his luck. However, he is strongly against
        dying a meaningless death or dying for the sake of despair.
        <br />
        After discovering that he and his classmates were the Remnants of
        Despair, Nagito began to act arrogant, impatient, and disrespectful
        towards his former idols. He had particularly little patience for the
        slow-witted ones, including Kazuichi Soda and Akane Owari. Nagito
        realized that by killing his classmates and therefore destroying the
        Ultimate Despair, he could himself become the Ultimate Hope. Though he
        claimed it was for the sake of the world's hope, it's also implied he
        wanted to become Ultimate Hope so he could finally be appreciated, even
        if only after his death.
        <br />
        Nagito believes his views on hope are logical and extremely obvious and
        has trouble relating to others when they disagree. Though he is very
        stubborn, he has changed his ways of thinking during the series. He is
        sometimes conflicted between his extreme beliefs and his own feelings.
        He calls himself "worthless trash" that doesn't deserve any kindness
        from others, but at the same time, he desires to be appreciated, loved
        and understood. In his fifth free-time event, Nagito revealed that his
        true, biggest wish is to be loved by someone at least once in his life,
        and to not die alone. Furthermore, even though he greatly admires and
        claims to love all of the Ultimates for their talents and capability to
        embody hope, he doesn't really care about them as individuals. He isn't
        truly saddened by their deaths, and even appears to dislike some of them
        as people. Similarly, he may not have anything personal against the
        talentless—in fact, the only student Nagito genuinely cared for is
        Hajime, a talentless reserve course student.
        <br />
        In Super Danganronpa 2.5, based on what the World Destroyer said about
        his illusionary world reflecting his desires, Nagito may actually have a
        hidden hatred towards talent and wishes for a world without talent
        because he believes the world and its people would be better if talents
        were taken away so everyone can become equal and free. For example,
        Kazuichi's illusion form reflects his insecurities about not being good
        enough for some people's company. In Danganronpa 2, Nagito is seen
        showing interest in Hajime because he doesn't feel like an Ultimate to
        him and thus they're more similar and equal in his eyes. His wish to
        live an ordinary life with someone is also mentioned in Zansakura
        -zanka-, which is a song about his inner feelings. In the OVA, Nagito
        was both shocked and embarrassed to realize that he may actually have
        such emotions and thoughts, as he usually claims that only those with
        great talent can bring great hope. Naturally, he was relieved that
        nobody else saw this side of him during his comatose state. Despite
        learning about this hidden side of himself, he refuses to accept it and
        instead continue with his desire for hope. In the end, he is shown
        taking Hajime's hand and deciding to move towards hope, implying that
        being with Hajime is his hope.
        <br />
        It also should be noted that Nagito genuinely respects ideals such as
        love and friendship, and often emphasizes the importance of team-work
        and helping each other. This became more noticeable after he came out of
        the NEO World Program with his past memories restored.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Behaviour (this guy is so real hayley bro i might be starting to get it)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Nagito has a laid-back and quite calm demeanor, and he is often smiling
        or laughing. However, his cheerfulness may not be entirely genuine, as
        his calmness is more akin to apathy and he tends to feel strong
        self-hatred. He remains cheerful even during his self-loathing rambling,
        and acts disturbingly optimistically toward horrible things such as
        death, as long as it's for the sake of hope.
        <br />
        Nagito likely suppresses any real feelings of sorrow or fear as a coping
        mechanism, because he experiences tragedy often due to his luck. He has
        also seen very unlikely and strange things due to his luck, which is why
        he is not easily surprised. As a result of everything he's been through,
        he has become more emotionally numb and he is rarely openly angry or
        scared. He often lacks appropriate emotions in situations where most
        people would be afraid, like threats of violence. Even so, he once
        mentioned that he feels fear every day of his life, most likely because
        of his luck. Furthermore, he can be very angered by despair and other
        things he considers insulting toward hope. When he does express anger,
        he becomes notably more serious. When displeased, he is very
        passive-aggressive.
        <br />
        Nagito is capable of feeling some guilt and care for others, and he does
        not truly enjoy the suffering of others, but the hope born from it.
        Still, he is typically very emotionally cold and doesn't seem to feel
        much remorse or grief neither. He's shown to be fine with tricking,
        manipulation, and stealing, though it should be noted that he does these
        for the sake of a bigger goal rather than his own ends. He has been
        described as a very honest person, though he will lie if he finds it
        necessary. While he prefers to do things on his own, he is very lonely
        and often tries to join the other Ultimates in their activities and
        becomes really happy if he's given attention, even if just a little bit.
        It's also implied that he intentionally keeps his distance from others
        because he wants to protect them from the disasters caused by his bad
        luck.
        <br />
        Nagito is also one of the most intelligent characters of the second
        game, being very cunning and smart. He often solves a case long before
        the others, but he doesn't want credit for this. Instead, he often acts
        ignorant during the trials, manipulates the conversation by giving
        (often unnoticed) hints and then praises the others as if they're the
        ones who figured it all out. He does this because he considers himself
        too unimportant to take a more openly active role, wants to see the
        other Ultimates figure things out by themselves, and he wishes to remain
        neutral until he can determine which side has the stronger hope.
      </p>
      <h2>Social Impairment</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, Nagito appears to be somewhat out of touch with his own
        feelings. He tries to be polite, but he can be overly harsh and
        insensitive, often without realizing it. He has a lack of social
        awareness and insight into his own behavior. Because of this, he has
        problems understanding how his own behavior can affect other people and
        he may not understand or pick up on social hints. He struggles with
        expressing himself in a socially appropriate manner and this often leads
        to people misunderstanding what he's trying to say, and vice versa.
        During Chapter 1's additional dialogue, Nagito explains that he says
        dubious things without meaning to and that he realizes this, but can't
        stop it from happening. However, he also adds that he always sincerely
        means what he says.
        <br />
        In Chapter 4 of Danganronpa 2, he accidentally offended both Kazuichi
        and Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu—in Fuyuhiko's case, he understood that he said
        something wrong and quickly apologized, but remained quite confused, and
        misunderstood what he said wrong. For Kazuichi, he was completely
        oblivious and only noticed that Kazuichi seemed angry for some reason.
        Other examples of this type of behavior include his odd and awkward
        sense of humor, often making jokes at inappropriate times, like soon
        after someone's death. He usually backs off if the others explain to him
        that his behavior is rude or he tells them he wasn't being serious.
        Similarly, when he tries to compliment someone, it can come across as an
        insult. His gauge of sarcasm is quite poor, too, as he sometimes
        mistakes mean comments for compliments. He also doesn't understand why
        the others are paranoid, angry and afraid of him. He's often confused by
        the others' behavior, thinking that they're strange for acting so
        suspicious of him, to the point that he sometimes worries about their
        mental health. He thinks that the others hate him because he's a lower
        human being.
        <br />
        In his final free-time event, Nagito claims to have Frontotemporal
        Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease that affects their personality and
        social cognition and thus may account for some of his strange behavior.
        He claims he was lying immediately afterward and it is unknown whether
        this was a lie or not. Nevertheless, it is clear that he has some type
        of psychological disorder.
        <br />
        It should be noted that Nagito's strange luck affects his condition as
        well, seemingly allowing him to live much longer than he should have,
        and likely giving him unusual symptoms.

      <h1>Trivia >:3</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>It was revealed that Nagito Komaeda is an anagram of "Naegi Makoto da" which means "I'm Makoto Naegi" in Japanese. According to Kodaka and Yoshinori Terasawa, the anagram was made as a hook to Danganronpa 1 fans due to the lack of promotion materials pre-release of the original version of Danganronpa 2 in 2012. Kodaka wanted the fans to speculate that somehow Makoto and Nagito are connected in a way, and even cast the Japanese voice actress of Makoto, Megumi Ogata, to elaborate that idea even further.</li>
          <li>Nagito is born on the 28th day of the fourth month. In Japan, 4 is considered very unlucky because one of its pronunciations (shi) is similar to how you would pronounce "death." In China, 8 is a very lucky number because it is pronounced similarly to the word "fortune" (ba or fa). The word is also phonetically similar to the word for a "hundred" (bai), alluding to greater wealth, and the laid down 8 is a symbol of infinity. 28 equates to "double luck," meaning that his birth month represents bad luck while his birthday represents the double luck which cancels the aforementioned misfortune.</li>
          <li>Nagito's Free-Time Events reveal that he was diagnosed with stage 3 malignant lymphoma and frontotemporal lobe dementia. While it is left ambiguous in the game, his illnesses and backstory are confirmed in the side materials as well as in his school profile in Danganronpa 3.
            <ul>
              <li>He appears to suffer from behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), which symptoms may include changes in social and personal behavior, loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others, inappropriate social behavior, poor impulse control and judgment, apathy, loss of empathy, mental rigidity, repetitive compulsive behavior, a decline in self-care and personal hygiene, changes in food preferences, delusions, euphoria, and lack of awareness of any thinking or behavior changes. Needless to say, this explains a good deal of Nagito's unethical behavior and emotional instability.</li>
              <li>Other indications of his sickly state include his complexion, hair color, and breathy voice. In Island Mode, it's mentioned that he has poor stamina, very sensitive skin, and he seems to dislike running. His character profiling describes his "pallid skin of the diseased" as well as his hair color, which "doesn't look like it belongs on a living person."</li>
              <li>The Despair Disease had a much worse effect on Nagito than anyone else and almost killed him, presumably because he was already very ill.</li>
              <li>Izuru Kamukura mentions that Nagito has a scent of someone who is "already finished," referring to the fact that he should already be dead, but his luck is keeping him alive.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Nagito is shown to be attracted to characters of the same gender.
            <ul>
              <li>In Nagito's fifth Free Time Event in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair with Hajime, he ends his event with the line: "From the bottom of my heart... I am truly in love with the hope that sleeps inside you." In the original Japanese version of this line, Nagito uses the unambiguous and very strong romantic word "aishiteiru" (愛している).</li>
              <li>In Nagito's character song from Danganronpa Another Episode, Poison -gekiyaku- (lit. Poison -deadly drug-), Nagito sings in English about loving an ambiguous "him": "I love and want to understand him more than anyone else, more, more than anyone else."</li>
              <li>In the Danganronpa Another Story (Crimson Version) drama CD, in a conversation between Nagito and Hajime, Nagito tells him: "I won't give up. I'll continue to do anything in my power to assist you. Because... I like you. I love you, for being willing to talk to me like this, even after knowing what a hopelessly incompetent person I am." However, the drama CDs are not considered canonical.</li>
              <li>Although Danganronpa 2's Island Mode is also not considered canonical, Nagito flirts with Hajime in several instances:
                <ul>
                  <li>If Hajime takes Nagito on a successful date, Nagito tells him: "For some reason... it scares me to think that I'm having fun without experiencing any bad luck. I mean, I feel so lucky right now that it wouldn't surprise me if one or two people I knew had died! But I should stop thinking about such dangerous things and get ready to go home to our love nest!" This line is the same in the Japanese version, where he calls it "ボクたちの愛の巣へ" (bokutachi no ai no su e lit. our nest of love).</li>
                  <li>If Hajime selects "let's take off our clothes" on a Beach date, Nagito comments: "Does that mean... you want to go in the ocean with me? I think that's a bad idea. There are lots of ways that could be dangerous. But I don't mind if you just want to see me naked."</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>He really likes go stones, because the black (dark) and white (light) stones remind him of the battle between hope and despair. In Danganronpa 3 - Despair Arc's Episode 4, two go stone jars can be seen inside his bag, along with the bomb switch and Dr. Hopper cans.</li>
          <li>Interestingly, the events of self-harming leading up to Nagito's suicide in Chapter 5 mirror certain details of the deaths in the first game; Sayaka Maizono was stabbed, Chihiro Fujisaki was tied up, Sakura Ogami was poisoned in a locked room setting, and Mukuro Ikusaba was speared.</li>
          <li>In Island Mode, Nagito expresses intense fear towards fighter jets and it's strongly implied that he may suffer from the fear of flying because of his past trauma. While he is generally paranoid about many things, he appears to be extremely paranoid and afraid of plane crashes as just thinking or talking about it makes him very anxious. The idea of people being trapped inside, with no way to escape and just waiting to crash, terrifies him a lot.
            <ul>
              <li>Despite this, he was seen on an airplane which crashed in Danganronpa 3 - Despair Arc. It's possible that he feels more comfortable while traveling alone, as he doesn't put other people's lives at risk. Considering his wealth, it's likely that he can afford to travel all by himself.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony's non-canon bonus mode, Ultimate Talent Development Plan, Celestia Ludenberg challenged Nagito and Makoto to Mahjong to test their luck. She then suggests they add the headmaster, Jin Kirigiri, to even things out. This is likely a reference to an official art from Danganronpa 1.2 Reload where the same event happened.</li>
          <li>Nagito's Japanese voice actress, Megumi Ogata, has sung three songs to the point where she sung in-character as Nagito who has his own mini album due to his popularity.
            <ul>
              <li>He has his own character song called Poison -gekiyaku-.</li>
              <li>Zettai Kibō Birthday, one of the two songs on the album, is also the ending theme of Danganronpa 3 - Despair Arc.</li>
              <li>The other song on the album is titled Zansakura -zanka-.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
